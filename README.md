# Chemical-space-prediction
- A multi-classification model which predicts the area of chemical space that a given compound lies in. 
- The key components involve RMM (molecualr weight), HAC (heavy atom count), AlogP (lipophilicity), and these are used to help the model predict whether or not the compound lies in Fragment/Lead/Drug space.
